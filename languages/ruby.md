### Editing Ruby in Zed

When editing Ruby, Zed provides code intelligence using the [Solargraph](https://solargraph.org/) language server.

### Setup

Zed currently doesn't install Solargraph automatically. To use Solargraph, you need to install the gem. Zed just looks for an executable called `solargraph` on your `PATH`.

You can install the gem manually with the following command:

```shell
gem install solargraph
```

Alternatively, if your project uses Bundler, you can add the Solargraph gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'solargraph', group: :development
```

### Configuration

Solargraph reads its configuration from a file called `.solargraph.yml` in the root of your project. For more information about this file, see the [Solargraph configuration documentation](https://solargraph.org/guides/configuration).
