# System Requirements

### macOS

Supported versions: Catalina (10.15) - Ventura (13.x).

**Notices**

* The implementation of our screen sharing feature makes use of [LiveKit](https://livekit.io). The LiveKit SDK requires macOS Catalina (10.15); consequently, in v0.62.4, we dropped support for earlier macOS versions that we were initially supporting.

### Linux, Windows, and Web

_Not supported at this time. See our_ [_Platform Support_](https://github.com/zed-industries/feedback/issues/174) _issue._
