# Giving feedback

### Feedback repository

We track our issues at [`zed-industries/feedback`](https://github.com/zed-industries/feedback/issues).

#### Feature requests

Try to focus on the things that are most critical to you rather than exhaustively listing all features another editor you have used has.

Command palette action: `request feature`

#### Bug reports

Try to add as much detail as possible, if it is not obvious to reproduce. Let us know how severe the problem is for you; is the issue more of a minor inconvenience or something that would prevent you from using Zed?

Command palette action: `file bug report`

### Zed forum

Use the [community forum](https://forum.zed.dev/) to ask questions and learn from one another. We will be present in the forum and answering questions as well.

### Discord server

You can join our [Zed Insiders Discord server](https://discord.gg/SSD9eJrn6s) to chat with us and other insiders.

### Email

If you prefer to write up your thoughts as an email, you can send them to [hi@zed.dev](mailto:hi@zed.dev).
